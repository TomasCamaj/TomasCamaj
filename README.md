# Tomas — Building Intelligent Systems That Matter

> I don’t just write code — I design systems that solve real problems.

I’m a developer focused on artificial intelligence, backend engineering, and applied research.
My goal is to build technology that improves decision-making, expands access to knowledge, and creates measurable impact.

Currently exploring:

* Machine learning systems in production
* Medical AI and decision support
* Scalable backend architectures
* Data-driven product design
* Research-oriented software engineering
